### Science Teacher / KS3 Co-ordinator

#### From 2018 to Present | Calthorpe Park School

I have been teaching Science in all three subjects (Biology, Chemistry, Physics) from KS3 to KS4 for the past five years. I specialize in Physics at KS4 and am also responsible for the leadership and development of the KS3 Science curriculum within my school. In addition to my teaching duties, I also have pastoral roles as a vertical (year 7 to 11) tutor group leader. I line manage two members of my department to ensure positive growth in their careers.

I am a good team worker and communicator with members both inside and outside of my department. My colleagues have provided positive feedback about my approach to teaching and my enthusiastic attitude when it comes to sharing best practices. Outside of education, I have a large amount of knowledge and experience working within a highly specialized field (geophysics). Although my teaching experience might not be the longest, I have quickly learned and applied by understanding of education principles to create an effective learning environment for students at all levels.
